Our automated data visualization and machine learning web app is built using the Streamlit API with Python 3. We recommend running our program in the terminal by typing the following command:

`streamlit run app.py` 

in the project directory.

Use `pip3 install streamlit` to install the Streamlit plugins.

Simply upload a .csv file and follow the instructions to visualize your data using our UI.
